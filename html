    My art critiques social issues regarding the perception of women’s beauty, especially within the media. Within several mediums such as experimental filmmaking, digital and 35mm  film photography, my work captures powerful and beautiful imagery of real-life women throughout the modern era. My pieces have been thematically consistent from 2015 to the present day in which I’ve been creating series of highly colorful portrait images of women in my life, varying in tone and story.

    In 2016, I began to work with 35mm film photography. I initially wanted to work within a medium that physically connected me to my artwork.  Filmmaking and photography are both digital mediums that cannot be interacted with in a tactile manner. When using a  35mm camera, I am shooting on a fixed lens without a viewer. I had to relearn how to shoot without depending on the viewer and to perfect the aperture and f-stop. Within film photography, I’ve been primarily shooting simplistic,  noir, black and white photographs of landscapes or portraits. The primary difference between my work in film and digital is the lack of color. Instead, the shots focus on the simplistic nature of soft lighting and composition.

    With filmmaking, my work has been thematically varied, ranging from romantic comedies to documentary. My most recent film titled “Pose” is a dark experimental film shot on digital and VHS footage. The inspiration for the film  came from my own personal experience dealing with societal pressures of beauty standards. The film illuminates the psychological impact the media plays on women. Throughout the film, I used visual concepts of mirrors, photographs, and masks as pieces to illustrate the artificiality within the beauty industry. The color green is backlit during a horror montage sequence to represent the feelings of jealousy and envy. As I continue as an artist, I hope to create pieces that comment on the social and political injustices within my communities.
